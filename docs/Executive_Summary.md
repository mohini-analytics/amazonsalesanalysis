<b> Executive Summary & Key Findings


This project analysed over 600,000 Amazon UK product records to extract actionable insights related to category performance, pricing, customer ratings, and review behaviour.

 Key Findings

- A small number of categories contribute a disproportionate share of total demand.
- Higher prices do not consistently translate into higher customer ratings.
- Several categories show strong demand but below-average customer satisfaction.
- Products with low review volume may present early risk signals despite acceptable ratings.

Why?

- These insights support data-driven decisions around pricing optimisation, quality improvement, and category prioritisation, reducing reliance on intuition-driven decision-making.
