# Recommendations Based on Analysis

1. Prioritise High-Demand but Lower-Rated Categories
Target quality improvement and supplier reviews in categories with strong demand but below-average ratings.

2. Optimise Pricing in Higher Price Bands
Test pricing and bundling strategies where higher prices do not correspond to improved customer satisfaction.

3. Increase Visibility for High-Rated, Low-Review Products
Use promotions and placement strategies to drive adoption and validate performance.

4. Maintain Targeted Monitoring Rather Than Broad Intervention
No widespread high-risk patterns were identified; focused, data-backed monitoring is recommended.
