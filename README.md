<h1>Amazon Sales Analysis</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on extracting business insights from a large real-world product dataset using a combination of cloud-based and statistical tools.

- <b>Data was loaded and hosted on Google BigQuery, enabling fast SQL-based exploration and analysis of 600K+ records.</b>

- <b>SQL was used extensively to clean, filter, and transform the data, uncovering key metrics such as product counts, category trends, pricing patterns, brand performance, and missing data analysis.</b>

- <b>R was used for deeper statistical analysis, data wrangling (with dplyr, tidyverse), and to explore relationships between price, ratings, and reviews.</b>

- <b>Power BI was used to create dynamic dashboards and visual reports, making insights accessible to stakeholders with slicers and drill-downs.</b>

- <b>Google Docs was used to document analysis steps, SQL logic, visual summaries, and final recommendations â€” providing clear business-facing reports.</b>

This end-to-end approach demonstrates practical skills in querying big data, statistical interpretation, business-focused reporting, and stakeholder-ready storytelling.</b>
