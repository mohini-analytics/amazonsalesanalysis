<h1>Amazon Sales Analysis</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on extracting business insights from a large real-world product dataset using a combination of cloud-based and statistical tools.

- <b>Data was loaded and hosted on Google BigQuery, enabling fast SQL-based exploration and analysis of 600K+ records.</b>

- <b>SQL was used extensively to clean, filter, and transform the data, uncovering key metrics such as product counts, category trends, pricing patterns, brand performance, and missing data analysis.</b>

- <b>R was used for deeper statistical analysis, data wrangling (with dplyr, tidyverse), and to explore relationships between price, ratings, and reviews.</b>

- <b>Power BI was used to create dynamic dashboards and visual reports, making insights accessible to stakeholders with slicers and drill-downs.</b>

- <b>Google Docs was used to document analysis steps, SQL logic, visual summaries, and final recommendations — providing clear business-facing reports.</b>

This end-to-end approach demonstrates practical skills in querying big data, statistical interpretation, business-focused reporting, and stakeholder-ready storytelling.</b>

<h2>Business Problem Statement & Use Cases</h2>

<b>PROJECT OBJECTIVE<b>

Provide actionable, data-driven insights to improve product performance, pricing strategy, and category prioritisation for Amazon UK by analysing sales, pricing, reviews, and ratings data. The objective is to enable business stakeholders to identify high-value product categories, understand price sensitivity, and mitigate risks associated with low customer ratings and review volumes, thereby supporting informed commercial and operational decision-making.

<b>Business Context<b>

Amazon UK operates across thousands of product categories with varying price points, customer demand, and quality perception.
Business teams such as Category Management, Pricing, and Operations require reliable insights to answer questions like:

- Which categories contribute the most revenue but underperform on customer satisfaction?
- How does product pricing influence customer reviews and ratings?
- Where should improvement, promotion, or quality interventions be prioritised?

Without structured analytics and dashboards, these decisions rely on fragmented reports and intuition rather than evidence. This project simulates a real-world business analysis engagement, where raw product-level data is transformed into insights that support strategic and operational decisions.

<b>Stakeholder / User Role	Responsibility<b>

- Category Managers -	Own category performance, quality, and growth
- Pricing & Commercial Team	- Define pricing strategies and promotions
- Operations / Quality Teams -	Identify quality risks and improvement areas
- Senior Management -	Review performance and prioritise investments

<b> USE CASE 1 — Category Strategy & Performance Prioritisation <b>

Key Users- Category Managers, Senior Commercial Leadership

<b>Business Problem<b>

Amazon UK manages a large number of product categories, but not all categories perform equally in terms of revenue, customer satisfaction, and review volume.

Category managers need to answer:

- Which categories generate high sales but suffer from low customer ratings?
- Which categories have strong ratings but low review volume (potential growth opportunity)?
- Where should quality improvements or vendor interventions be prioritised?

Without this insight, teams risk: 
- Investing in low-impact categories
- Missing early warning signs of declining customer experience

<b>Business Questions<b>

- What are the top product categories by total sales and revenue?
- How do average ratings vary across high-revenue categories?
- Are there categories with high sales but below-average ratings?
- Which categories have low review counts, indicating limited customer feedback or adoption risk?

<b>Expected Insights<b>

- Identification of high-revenue, low-rating categories that require quality improvement
- Detection of high-rating but low-review categories with potential for promotion
- Clear category-level performance comparison to support prioritisation decisions

<b>Business Outcome<b>

- Category managers can prioritise corrective actions (quality checks, supplier reviews)
- Leadership gains visibility into where investment or intervention will deliver the highest ROI
- Data-backed discussions replace intuition-driven decisions

<b>USE CASE 2 — Price Sensitivity & Customer Perception<b>

Key Users- Pricing Team, Commercial Strategy Team

<b>Business Problem<b>

Pricing directly influences customer expectations, purchase behaviour, and satisfaction. However, pricing decisions are often made without clear visibility into how price correlates with ratings and reviews.

The pricing team needs to understand:
- Whether higher-priced products receive better or worse ratings
- If certain price bands consistently underperform in customer reviews
- Where pricing adjustments or promotional strategies may improve customer response

<b>Business Questions<b>

- How does the average rating change across different price ranges?
- Do higher-priced products receive fewer reviews, indicating lower purchase volume?
- Are there price thresholds where customer satisfaction drops significantly?
- Which price bands show the best balance of revenue and customer satisfaction?

<b>Expected Insights<b>

- Identification of price bands associated with lower ratings
- Understanding of review volume vs. price relationship
- Evidence to support pricing experiments, discounts, or bundling strategies

<b>Business Outcome<b>

- Pricing teams can optimise pricing strategies using data rather than assumptions
- Reduced risk of customer dissatisfaction due to misaligned pricing
- Improved alignment between price, perceived value, and customer experience

<b>USE CASE 3 — Review & Rating Risk Identification<b>
Key Users- Operations & Quality Teams

<b>Business Problem<b>
Low review counts and poor ratings can signal quality risks, supplier issues, or unmet customer expectations, but these signals are often detected too late.

Teams need early indicators to:
- Flag products or categories with declining ratings
- Identify products with low engagement (few reviews)
- Prevent reputational and revenue loss
